# ParallaxBA

This is the MATLAB code comparing Standard Bundle Adjustment(SBA) and Parallax Bundle Adjustment(PBA) for our paper "Comparison Between MATLAB Bundle Adjustment Function and Parallax Bundle Adjustment".

SBA MATLAB function from the Computer Vision toolbox is used, and PBA MATLAB is implemented by ourselves. 
For the comparison between the two BA methods, the "MALAGA PARKING-6L" and "Starry Night" datasets are used.

To compare two BA with "MALAGA PARKING-6L" and "Starry Night" datasets in MATLAB, 'Malaga_BundleAdjustment.m' and 'Starry_BundleAdjustment.m' can be executed, respectively.

In the case of the "Starry Might" dataset, the type of data can be changed between the data with 80 features and 500 features. 
The type of initial value and the number of images also can be chosen to run MATLAB for both BAs.
